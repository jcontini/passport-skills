```

use-plugin(plugin: "copilot", tool: "search", params: {query: "Amazon", limit: 50})
```

### spending_by_month

### recurring
List all recurring transactions with average amounts.

**Example:**

## Notes

- **Read-only** - Cannot modify transactions or accounts
- **Amount signs:** Negative = spending, positive = income/refunds

- **Categories:** Uses Plaid category strings (e.g., "Shops > Clothing") when available
