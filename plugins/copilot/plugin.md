## Common Workflows

### Review and categorize transactions
```
# 1. Get unreviewed transactions
unreviewed(days: 7)

# 2. Get available categories
list_categories()

# 3. Recategorize a transaction
recategorize(id: "abc123", category_id: "4P0OGwQa757X8J9N5ZA2")

# 4. Or bulk recategorize all from a merchant
recategorize_merchant(merchant: "TRADER JOE'S", category_id: "y2xtHJ2HbGucRPsm4eXv")
```

### Add notes and organize
```
# Add context to a transaction
add_note(id: "abc123", note: "Business dinner with client")

# Rename confusing merchant
rename(id: "abc123", name: "Costco Gas")

# Mark as transfer instead of spending
change_type(id: "abc123", type: "internal_transfer")
```

### Hide unwanted transactions
```
# Hide a transaction
hide(id: "abc123")

# View hidden transactions
hidden()

# Restore if needed
unhide(id: "abc123")
```

## Notes

- **Sync behavior**: User changes (category, notes, type) persist across Plaid syncs
- **Amount signs**: Negative = spending, positive = income/refunds
- **Categories**: Use `list_categories` to get valid category IDs before recategorizing
- **Bulk ops**: Use `recategorize_merchant` to set up "merchant rules" - all past and future transactions from that merchant will keep your category
- **What's NOT writable locally**: Budget amounts, tag definitions, and account settings are stored in Copilot's cloud (Firestore) and can't be modified locally

## Database Details

- **Database**: `~/Library/Group Containers/group.com.copilot.production/database/CopilotDB.sqlite`
- **Categories**: `~/Library/Group Containers/group.com.copilot.production/widget-data/widgets-category-categories.json`
- **Journal mode**: WAL (safe concurrent access)
