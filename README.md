# Passport Skills

Open-source skill definitions for [Passport](https://github.com/jcontini/passport).

Skills teach AI agents how to use your connected apps — they're markdown files with API documentation and configuration.

## What's a Skill?

A skill is a markdown file with:
- **YAML frontmatter** — metadata (auth config, abilities, API settings)
- **Instructions** — API docs the AI reads to make requests

Example:
```yaml
---
id: todoist
name: Todoist
description: Personal task management
category: productivity

abilities:
  - id: read_tasks
    label: "Read your tasks"
    read_only: true
  - id: write_tasks
    label: "Create and modify tasks"
  - id: delete_tasks
    label: "Delete tasks"
  - id: manage_projects
    label: "Manage projects"

auth:
  type: api_key
  header: Authorization
  prefix: "Bearer "
api:
  base_url: https://api.todoist.com

## Abilities

Abilities define what AI can do with a service. Users toggle these per account—like macOS app permissions.

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `id` | Yes | Unique identifier (e.g., `read_tasks`) |
| `label` | Yes | Human-readable name shown in UI |
| `read_only` | No | If `true`, this is a View ability. If `false`/absent, it's a Do ability. |

**Two types of abilities:**
- **View** (`read_only: true`) — Read/view data only, uses `passport_view` tool
- **Do** (default) — Take action (create, update, delete), uses `passport_do` tool

**Default access levels** (configurable in Settings):
- **Read only** — Auto-enable View abilities only
- **Full access** — Auto-enable all abilities (View + Do)

**Example abilities for Todoist:**
```yaml
abilities:
  - id: read_tasks
    label: "Read your tasks"
    read_only: true           # View ability
  - id: write_tasks
    label: "Create and modify tasks"
                              # Do ability (default)
  - id: delete_tasks
    label: "Delete tasks"
                              # Do ability
```

Users can have different abilities per account (e.g., Personal has full access, Work is read-only).
