  Linear-specific notes:
  - Uses GraphQL API
  - Issues have human-readable IDs like "AGE-123" (stored in source_id)
  - Priority: 0=None, 1=Urgent, 2=High, 3=Medium, 4=Low
  - Creating issues requires a team_id (use get_teams first)
  - Workflow states vary by team

Some Linear-specific operations are available through extended actions:

- `get_teams` - List teams (needed for creating issues)
- `get_workflow_states` - List states for a team
- `get_cycles` - List cycles for a team
- `add_blocking` - Set blocking relationships
- `add_related` - Link related issues
