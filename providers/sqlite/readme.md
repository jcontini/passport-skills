# SQLite

Connect to local SQLite database files.

## Setup

1. Get the path to your SQLite database file
2. Add it in AgentOS Settings → Connectors → SQLite

## Path Format

SQLite uses file paths instead of connection strings:

```bash
# Absolute path
/Users/joe/projects/myapp/data.sqlite

# Relative path (from AgentOS working directory)
./data/local.db

# Home directory expansion
~/Documents/app.sqlite3
```

## Common Locations

```bash
# macOS app data
~/Library/Application Support/[AppName]/database.sqlite

# Development databases
./prisma/dev.db
./db/development.sqlite3

# Browser data (careful - locked while browser is running)
~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default/History
```

## Limitations

- File must be readable by AgentOS
- Database is locked while another process has it open
- In-memory databases (`:memory:`) are not supported
- WAL mode databases require both .sqlite and .sqlite-wal files
